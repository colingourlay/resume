              <p><em>To work for a company which has challenging &amp; interesting problems I can attack using web-based technologies. I'm excited by real-time communication between the server and a wide range of client devices. I have a desire to build web apps that unite and empower the people using them.</em></p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I am a Scottish web developer, currently working in Brisbane, Australia. I'm very passionate about mobile development. My attention is focused on tuning websites and web apps to make them faster, more responsive and better suited to the needs of their users. I mostly work with JavaScript - my latest exporation being the world of server-side JS (thanks to Node.JS) - and would love to apply my skills to innovative products in performance-critical environments.</p>
            <p>Following my graduation from university my fiancé and I moved to Australia (her home country), where I began my professional career. We were married in June 2011. We constantly encourage each other to take chances and make the most of our talents.</p>
            <p>Through local tech meetups I was introduced to a community of developers who have been a brilliant source of inspiration &amp; knowledge. I've began to work on some of my side-projects in the open, and plan to continue feeding back into the community that has been so generous to me.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="span8">
            <p>I am currently working with the web technology team at APN, who build and maintain a news platform that supports websites for over 30 regional newspapers and their mobile counterparts, including dedicated apps for business listings, classifieds and user-generated content. As one of the team's front-end developers, I am constantly met with new, interesting challenges, including templating &amp; styling the data returned from the back-end, JavaScript plugin development, working with 3rd-party APIs, tightening our network performance and bringing structure to our ever-growing client-side codebase.</p>
            <p>Whenever possible, I challenge myself to take on a bit of back-end work, to ensure I keep in touch with that area of my talents. I've always considered myself a full-stack web developer, and I'm grateful that my team allow me to entertain that notion.</p>
            <p>In 2011, another developer and I ran a 12 week HTML/CSS course, open to anyone in the company who could find a use for it. University gave me a firm grounding in user-centered design and software development, but a lot of the skills I now apply to front-end development were self-taught. I thoroughly enjoyed passing on some of the things I've learned, and would gladly do it again.</p>

            <p>FlockEdu is a Scottish education startup that hopes to establish itself as a credible alternative to University. The website and platform was built over three weekends in a Hack Day environment (which we called 'Sweatshops'), with product/development/legal/etc. working in tandem. I was invited to be a part of their web development team, participating remotely from Australia (via Skype). I got some great experience working with a Rails app, and using GitHub with a large team. The weekend events were a great success, and I was thrilled to be working in a fast-paced environment with such an enthusiatic and talented team.</p>

            <p>I assisted the The University of Dundee's eLearning department with various software related tasks, such as black/white box testing, evaluation and documentation. I was also given small Blackboard Learn V8 Building Block development projects designed to extend the university's staff/student online resources. The work involved both front-end and back-end web applications development, and my code was used in live systems across the university campus.</p>
            <p>In Spring 2009, working in partnership with The University of Dundee's School of Midwifery, I spent two months developing a Blackboard Learn V9 Building Block to help enhance students' report writing standards. I was responsible for managing the project's technical aspects, as well as the software design and evaluation.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="span8">
            <p>During the course of my studies, my efforts were recognised by a top student award for my 2nd Year work on Computer Systems, as well as an award for being one of the top students in 3rd Year overall. I also won a Yahoo! sponsored “HackDay” and was invited for a phone interview for an internship at their headquarters in London. My greatest achievement was obtaining a first class degree, including an award for a first class Honours project.</p>
            <p>Each year, we were introduced to two or more new languages, so in my final year, when the focus shifted to research and self-directed projects, I decided to learn Python &amp; the Django web framework and build a browser-based Honours project. That experience convinced me that I wanted to work on the web for a living. It also gave me the abilities needed to secure my first job after arriving in Australia.</p>
